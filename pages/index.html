      <h3>About this project</h3>
        <div class="container">
          <p>The purpose of this project is to build a webserver in C using sockets so I can gain a better understanding of how webservers work as well as brush up a little bit on my C skills. In addition, it will provide a cool flex on other web developers and prove my superiority over everyone else. </p>
          <p>There were a couple of things I wanted to acomplist with the project:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Learn how to use sockets to create web applications</li>
              <li>Build HTML files using boilerplate code for the headers, navbar and footers</li>
              <li>Implement a filesystem based routing system</li>
              <li>Implemnent threading</li>
            </ol>
            <p>At this time, I have yet to implement the router or threading. This project was intended to be something quick, and I found myself taking way too much time on this project while I have other projects to be working on. I fully intend to come back to this in the future and implement the router at the very leat, but that will have to come after I finish some other projects.</p>
