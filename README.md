## A simple Webserver

For the past year, I have been focusing my learning time on Web Development, so I figured building a webserver would be a fantastic opportunity to learn about how webservers actually work on top of being a cool flex on other web developers.

The idea is to build a webserver that can parse routes and use a directory based routing structure like Next.js.
